For the CSC7 Final Project, Team Hard Stuck college decided to tackle the Vigenere Cipher Decryption implementation. The Vigenere Cipher is a type of encryption and decryption program that will encrypt/decrypt on user input. This cipher can only encrpyt/decrypt messages that has alphabetic characters. In order to decrypt or encrypt, this program needs to recieve both a message and a key from the user (all in alphabetic characters). Non-alphabetic characters cannot be encrypted/decrypted.
